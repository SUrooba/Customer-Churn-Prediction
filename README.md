# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning.  
Built in **Python (Colab)** with **scikit-learn, XGBoost, and SHAP** for model explainability.

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. Data loading & cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering & preprocessing
4. Model training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
5. Model evaluation: ROC-AUC, Precision/Recall, F1-score
6. Explainability with SHAP

## 📈 Results
- Best model: **XGBoost** with ROC-AUC = 0.85  
- Important factors for churn: contract type, tenure, monthly charges  
- Insights: Short-term, high-paying, month-to-month customers are most at risk of churn.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Matplotlib/Seaborn  
- Google Colab for development

## 🌐 Next Steps
- Build a Streamlit app for interactive predictions  
- Deploy on Streamlit Cloud or Render
